This is my main GitHub Repository for BS32011.
My aim for this module is to produce a logical and consistent framework for searching through experimental data on the subject of Transcription factor-induced pluripotent stem cells.
In order to do this raw GEO data must be munipulated, placed it organised relational tables using MySQL and finalising with applying python script to locate information from the tables onto a website in a user queriable fashion of my own design.
