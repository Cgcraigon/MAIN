This is for things that pop into my head. 
1. Parser could be updated to include headers for the tab delimited values.
2. Mysql tables could contain additional feilds to give more information about the expression values - would mean altering the parser.
3. Perhaps the cgi form could could do some simple graphical processing of the data using R ~ maybe.
4. Given more time could have the information produced from CGI to be stored in a txt format, that would allow the user to download the information. 
5. Perhaps it could be given more information from multiple GEO sets allowing for further experimental anaylsis. 
6. Have a link on the website containg the original Geo.soft file "Might actually do this, if Dr Martin says yes"
